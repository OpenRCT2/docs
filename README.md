# docs
Documentation and gameplay manual for OpenRCT2.

The live branch can be viewed here: https://docs.openrct2.io  

The pages are written in a markup language called [**ReStructuredText**](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) (RST). It is conceptually similar to Markdown and Wikipedia pages.

## Guidelines:

Be sure to follow these guidelines prior to writing pages, taking screenshots/GIFs, or making pull requests.

1. Write documentation in UK English, like the game itself.

2. Add screenshots and GIFs to your pages.  

3. Set the game to UK English, pounds sterling, metric, Celsius and the default (RCT2) theme when taking screenshots or GIFs.  
   
   Keep these settings for consistency. If the context calls for it, you may deviate from this. For example: if you're demonstrating the theming capabilities of OpenRCT2, including a screenshot with a non-standard theme makes sense.

4. Covering basic gameplay has the biggest priority. Later on, we want to branch out to more advanced topics.

If you need ideas on what to write, there is a draft of the Table of Contents here: https://github.com/OpenRCT2/docs/blob/master/toc.md  
*Make sure to focus on the bits under “Playing” first (see point 4)*

## Building:

If you want to build the docs yourself, you’ll need Python 3, as well as a few additional libraries. On Debian-like, these can be installed as follows:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-packaging python3-jinja2 python3-snowballstemmer python3-imagesize python3-alabaster
```
