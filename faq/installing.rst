Is RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 required to play OpenRCT2?
----------------------------------------------------

Yes, OpenRCT2 needs a copy of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 or RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic for its graphics and sound assets. 
Itâ€™s recommended to also install Wacky Worlds, Time Twister and RollerCoaster Tycoon 1, but this is not required.

Does OpenRCT2 work with all versions of RCT2?
---------------------------------------------

OpenRCT2 works fully with the following releases of RCT2:

- Original CD version (expansion packs are recommended, otherwise the expansion rides and scenery will appear invisible)
- Triple Thrill Pack CD version
- GOG version (not the Russian release, which is discussed below)
- Steam version
- Discord Nitro version
- CD Projekt Polish CD version
- RCT Classic

OpenRCT2 partially works with the following releases of RCT2:

- RCT2 Mini Game (lacks some objects, which will appear invisible, and most scenarios)
- Akella/GOG Russian version (font issues. OpenRCT2 ships with a full Russian sprite font set, so if you want to play in Russian, you should still install the English GOG version)

How can I add the scenarios from RCT1?
--------------------------------------

There are two options:

1. Linking OpenRCT2 to RCT1. This not only makes the scenarios available, but also additional land types and some other small features. This is the best solution. You do need to own RCT1 with Loopy Landscapes or RCT Deluxe for this, though. It can be bought from sites like GOG, Fanatical or Steam, going as low as $1-$3 during sales.
2. Using recreated scenarios. These are pretty close matches, but not as close as using the originals. However, they can be downloaded for free `here <http://www.mediafire.com/download/3cw47sd2wt3hues/ExactRCT1Recreations.zip>`_.
