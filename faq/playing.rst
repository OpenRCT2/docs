Can I play OpenRCT2 in my own language?
---------------------------------------

OpenRCT2 is available in over 20 languages, including all languages that RCT2 was originally released in. The in-game language can be changed from the Options window.

Some letters are substituted for others (e.g. all l’s are replaced with j’s)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This happens when the ``g2.dat`` file is out of date. This is usually the result of only replacing ``openrct2.exe`` instead of all the data files. This can easily be solved by reinstalling OpenRCT2. Your saves and scenario progress will not be erased if you do so.
