Getting RCT2
============

OpenRCT2 needs the object files (containing graphics, sounds and models) from the original RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 or RCT Classic to work. You'll need to have a copy of RCT2 or RCTC before beginning.

Where can I get it?
-------------------

If you have an old CD copy sitting around, you're good - move on to step two.

Otherwise, you can buy the game at `GOG.com <https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2>`_ or `through Steam <https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack>`_. The GOG version is strongly recommended for those on Linux or macOS for ease of installation. Both of the packs linked also contain the two expansion packs, Wacky Worlds and Time Twister.

RollerCoaster Tycoon 1
----------------------

OpenRCT2 can also import scenarios and some graphics from the original RollerCoaster Tycoon (RCT1). This is recommended, but not required. If this is something you'd like to do, get your RCT1 and Loopy Landscapes CDs ready or purchase a copy. 
You can also get RCT1 through `GOG <https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_deluxe>`_ or `Steam <https://store.steampowered.com/app/285310/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_Deluxe>`_.
