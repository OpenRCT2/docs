System requirements
===================

OpenRCT2 should be able to run on almost every computer made in the last five years, and probably even older computers.
An important thing to consider is that the game will use the native resolution of your monitor by default. If you run into performance problems, try lowering the used resolution in the Options window (this requires regular fullscreen mode) or resizing the window if you use windowed mode.

OpenRCT2 needs about 250 MB of disk space, including the required files from RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. You will need additional disk space for your own scenarios, saved games and custom objects. A saved game can take between 500 kB and 7 MB, depending on the amount of custom objects. In general, having 1 GB or more of free disk space is recommended.

OpenRCT2 needs about 500 MB of free RAM. If your system is equipped with 2 GB of RAM or more, it should be sufficient, though 1.5 GB or less might also work.

Since OpenRCT2 runs in software rendering mode (by default), the CPU is much more heavily used than the GPU. A simple video chip will be sufficient. An OpenGL mode is also available in the Options window.

Operating system
----------------

Currently, OpenRCT2 runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. There is also an experimental Android port.

- Windows: 7 or higher
- macOS: 10.13 (High Sierra) or higher
- Linux: confirmed to work on Ubuntu (18.04 and higher) and Arch, but you should be able to compile it on any modern distribution. The goal is to eventually have OpenRCT2 in the repositories of many distributions.
- FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD: minimum version unknown.

OpenRCT2 does not officially work on Windows XP. At the time of writing (24 October 2020) it is still possible to compile OpenRCT2 for Windows XP, but there is no guarantee.
Support for other BSD operating systems should be easy to add.
