Installing OpenRCT2 on macOS
============================

To install OpenRCT2 on macOS, go to https://openrct2.io/ and download either the latest release or a development build. The builds are packages in a ZIP file. Extract it, then drag OpenRCT2.app to Applications.

In order to run, OpenRCT2 will need some files from RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. If you have a Windows machine at hand, you can simply install it and then copy the ``RollerCoaster Tycoon 2`` folder to your Mac. It does not matter where you place this folder, but keep a note where you put it, as OpenRCT2 will ask for this location when it starts for the first time.

If you don't have a Windows machine at hand, you can extract the files from a RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 installation disc or from GOG or Steam. You can read how to do this on this page: https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Installation-on-Linux-and-macOS

Once you installed OpenRCT2 and copied the necessary RCT2, you can attempt to run it. Most likely, macOS will not run the application, as it does not recognise it. You can whitelist the application by opening System Prefences, navigating to “Security & Privacy” and clicking “Open Anyway”.
